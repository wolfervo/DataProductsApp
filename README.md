Repository for Coursera Developing Data Products course project - Shiny App

This repository contains all files for my Developing Data Products course project submission including: Shiny App files (server.R and ui.R), Slidify Presentation files (.Rmd, .md, and .html), and a .nojekyll file to allow the presentation to be viewed as an html file directly in a browser.
